# sunrise-alarm
(WiP) A fake sunrise alarm that gradually brightens before an alarm goes off.

Inspired by https://blog.sebasgo.net/2019/02/28/sunrise-alarm-clock-pi-dawn/ ( https://github.com/sebasgo/pi-dawn ) but reinventing the wheel because it's fun.

# Development

This is based on lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template, originally created via

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template sunrise-alarm
```
