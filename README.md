# sunrise-alarm
An LED clock that can run animations on a schedule, including a fake sunrise

Inspired by https://blog.sebasgo.net/2019/02/28/sunrise-alarm-clock-pi-dawn/ ( https://github.com/sebasgo/pi-dawn ) but reinventing the wheel because it's fun.

git clone https://github.com/elliotf/sunrise-alarm.git
